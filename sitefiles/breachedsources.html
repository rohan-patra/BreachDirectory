<p>In 2014, a file allegedly containing data hacked from <a href="https://www.couponmom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coupon Mom</a> was created and included 11 million email addresses and plain text passwords. On further investigation, the file was also found to contain data indicating it had been sourced from <a href="https://armorgames.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armor Games</a>. Subsequent verification with HIBP subscribers confirmed the passwords had previously been used and many subscribers had used either Coupon Mom or Armor Games in the past. On disclosure to both organisations, each found that the data did not represent their entire customer base and possibly includes records from other sources with common subscribers. The breach has subsequently been flagged as "unverified" as the source cannot be emphatically proven.</p>

<p>In September 2016, over 16GB of logs from a service indicated to be digimon.co.in were obtained, most likely from an unprotected Mongo DB instance. The service ceased running shortly afterwards and no information remains about the precise nature of it. Based on <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1045178309926051840" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enquiries made via Twitter</a>, it appears to have been a mail service possibly based on PowerMTA and used for delivering spam.

<p>In March 2018, the Florida Virtual School (FLVS) <a href="https://www.flvs.net/notices?source=homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a data breach notification to their website</a>. The school had identified a data breach which had occurred sometime between 6 May 2016 and 12 Feb 2018 and an XML file containing 368k student records was subsequently found circulating. Each record contained student name, date of birth, password, grade, email <em>and</em> parent email resulting in a total of 543k unique email addresses. Due to the prevalence of email addresses belonging to individuals who are still legally children, the data breach has been flagged as "sensitive".</p>

<p>An alleged breach of the dating website <a href="http://www.justdate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justdate.com</a> began circulating in approximately September 2016. Comprised of over 24 million records, the data contained various personal attributes such as email addresses, dates of birth and physical locations. However, upon verification with HIBP subscribers, only a fraction of the data was found to be accurate and no account owners recalled using the Justdate.com service. This breach has consequently been flagged as <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-fabricated-data-breaches-to-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fabricated</a>; it's highly unlikely the data was sourced from Justdate.com.</p>

<p>In September 2016, data was allegedly obtained from the Chinese website known as <a href="http://www.uuu9.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uuu9.com</a> and contained 7.5M accounts. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as "unverified".

<p>In approximately 2011, an alleged breach of the dating website <a href="https://www.zoosk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoosk</a> began circulating. Comprised of almost 53 million records, the data contained email addresses and plain text passwords. However, during extensive verification in May 2016 <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-how-i-verify-data-breaches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence could be found that the data was indeed sourced from the dating service</a>. This breach has consequently been flagged as <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-fabricated-data-breaches-to-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fabricated</a>; it's highly unlikely the data was sourced from Zoosk.</p>

<p>In September 2019, the zoophilia and bestiality forum <a href="https://www.zooville.org/threads/security-incident-and-site-rebuild-september-2019.9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zooville suffered a data breach</a>. The usernames and email addresses of 71k members were accessed via an unpatched vulnerability in the vBulletin forum software then subsequently distributed online. A second data set was later provided to HIBP which contained a complete vBulletin database dump including IP addresses, dates of birth and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. The site administrator advised that following the breach, all data had been deleted from the forum and a new one had been stood up on the XenForo platform. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to "burger vault".</p>
